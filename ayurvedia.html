    <div class="discrip"><p>You must be wondering what can be healthy things to eat at night, right? Worry not, just follow these simple tips for dinner.</p></div>
<div class="discrip"><ul class="fontweight">
<li>It is suggested to eat food that is easy to digest at night. Also, try to eat a healthy and low-carb diet as it gets digested easily.</li>
<li>If you have the habit of eating curd at night, replace it with buttermilk. Prefer chapatis over rice since chapatis are easy and quicker to digest.</li>
<li>Do not overstuff yourself. Eat in limited quantities</li>
<li>Try to include more of dal, green leafy vegetables, curry leaves, and a small amount of ginger in your meal.</li>
<li>Salt is supposed to increase the water retention in the body. Hence, it is better to cut down on the intake of salt.</li>
<li>Spices, on the other hand, increase warmth in your body, so try to include spices in your food.</li>
<li>Reduce the sugar intake and replace it with honey as it helps in reducing the mucus.</li>
<li>If you have the habit of drinking milk before you sleep, prefer low-fat milk. Always boil the milk before drinking it. This makes it easier to digest. You can also add a small amount of ginger or cardamom to the milk before boiling it, which helps in reducing the mucus generating properties.</li>
<li>Do not drink cold milk. Have it while it is still warm.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class = "discrip"><p>The thumb rule you must follow while having your dinner is to make sure that whatever you eat, you should not get a feeling of heaviness in the stomach. Instead, your stomach must feel light so that you can sleep properly.</p></div>
<div class="discrip"><p>Does eating at night make you fat? There are chances. Since your body does not perform any physical activity at night, it requires less energy. And, if you eat in large quantities at night, the energy that is produced from the food gets stored in the body in the form of fat, and this finally leads to obesity or weight gain.</p></div>
