<h4>StyleCraze Editorial Policies & Quality Standards

<h3>Our Editorial Principles</h3>

<u>
    <li>Readers First: Every article is written and published with the reader in mind. We ensure to cover content that you are looking for to help you up your beauty, health, and wellness routines. Our language is simple, and we avoid using complex jargon.</li>

    <Li>Accuracy & Reliability: Our content is current, based on extensive research, and fact-checked and reviewed by members of our medical board and expert panel. We also get in touch with board-certified doctors, registered dietitians, dermatologists, and licensed estheticians to ensure you get access to expert-approved advice and hacks (if any).</Li>

    <li>Inclusivity & Sensitivity: Our content is primarily written for a US audience. But we make sure that our language promotes respect and inclusivity of different age groups, ethnicities, genders and sexual orientations, physical and mental abilities, and relationship statuses. The articles use empathetic, compassionate, and person-first language.</li>

Articles in association with brands are clearly labeled ‘Sponsored’ and do not reflect the opinions of the editorial team. <span>Read our advertising policy.</span></p>
